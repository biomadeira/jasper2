With the release of Azure Percept Studio and the Azure Percept Device Kit, Microsoft has made it easy to create and deploy AI models to edge devices. A demonstrator project can be up and running in minutes, but what if you want to build a more sustainable solution?

In this and future posts I'll share how I'm creating a more sustainable and maintainable environment for building and deploying IoT Edge based solutions using Azure Percept and its Device Kit. This post will cover creating an Azure environment for hosting these solutions in a repeatable way. Future posts will cover other aspects such as Device Updates, Continuous Integration and Deployment, Cost Optimization and potentially availability and continuity.

# Azure Percept and the OOBE
I've been working with the Azure Percept 

### There are a few things that you should know up-front:
1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so **does** require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.


Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our [Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
